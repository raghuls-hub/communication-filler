Hey, Act as a project analyser and features creator for the below scenario :
I am going to create a professional college communication among management, classes, teachers and represtatives of the class
Technical stacks : 
Frontend : React
Database : Firestore
Backend : Firebase
Authentication : Firebase Auth 
Deployment : Google Cloud

My ideas of the products : 
After login the landing page should be :
like a flowchart in the heirarchy of 
college -> department -> class -> All subjects
All the icons are clickable to go inside for more options :
In college : Write only by the college directors
shows all events and important announcement for the whole college 
In Department : Write by HODs and some teachers
shows the department wise anouncements, Events, Time tables.
In class : Write by tutors and representatives (Each class have three tutors) 
Shows announcements by tutors, tasks and the students can reply for a chat when that chat is allowed to message by the tutors
All subjects : Write by repective subject teachers and representatives 
Shows announcements, tasks by teachers and reply by the students

Unique features :
A professional avatar for all users which can do :
remaind all the tasks which are came from the all anouncemnts ,tasks to the user and orders them in time and authority priority.
A mini assistant to the user

small annoncements are cleared after a period of time so that we can save the space complexity

We are going to connects the directors,tutors,students by each class's code which limits can be set when creation

all chats are organized by a floating tab on the right top side which can navigate to the all annoucements, events , tasks in that chat coversation and this features works in the messages classification stratergy which mentioned below. 
the messages created by anyone under these types :
messages span : temp or permenant 
messages important : low or mid or high
messages reaching destinies : according to hierarchy of the flowchart the desdtiny can be setted like if is it a staff, can send to class students
Message type : replyable or announcement or event

all students have a facility to DM for their teachers 
students send the leave or on duty or any other permission to their respectives tutors and they can be managed from the teachers side by the mini assistant

have different colors to the respective message denoting the importance and span and type messages 

Analyse this project deeply and advice some unique features which makes this site very usefull and advance managing the messages than the normal whatsapp group
